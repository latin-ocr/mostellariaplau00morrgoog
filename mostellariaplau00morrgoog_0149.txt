will suit the three places where Pl. uses it, better than the
definition in And. Lex.

, 80. Postules, “seelr,’‘ “desire'’ asin I. 3. 102.

81. Quin feram. ‘⁶ Well, you may be sure, Ι will take it.” see 1.
3· 16, ( )·

82. Quid als tu? Quidvis? These two questions are very
frequently used together by ΡΙ. The first is meant to attract
attention, the second. to show on the part of the person
addressed that he is listening, and then follows the main
question, to which it was desired to call attention. Comp.
Trin. Ι. 2. 159, lV. 2. 85-86. Quid ais tu? therefore means,
“What do you say to the question lam going to ask?’'
(wag.)

86. Obici . . . ob os An unusual construction for the dat. The
form obicio for objicio is not given by And. Lex, but is
adopted in a number of texts to the exclusion of obs'z'cio.

91. Qui sit, unde sit. lndirect questions in appos. with istuc.
Qui for quis, as often. Vnde sit refers to genus, 90, and
may be rendered'“of what class he is.‘'

93. Eut. This word is omitted by most editors, as merely a repe·
tition of the preceding word. But we may suppose that
Tran. begins his answer in away which would lead to too
full a statement, and therefore breaks it oli.

94. Quasi, “about'’

95. Paulum. The mina was equal to about 818, which would
make the whole sum 8720. Thirty minae were used to buy
the freedom of Philem, and the rest were for general ex-
penses. Comp. lll. r. 7, and V. 3. 38-39.

96. Adeo etiam, “besides this Ι hear that interest also is due.'’
Quatuor, in next line, the interest.
