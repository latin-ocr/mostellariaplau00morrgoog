334, d. The indic. lor the subjunc. in indirect questions is
frequentin Pl. and Ter. lt arose in conversational lan·
guage from the tendency to emphasize the question for
greater vividness and to make the leading verb parenthetic.
Thus in many questions with quaeso, opsecro, cedo, the ques-
tion may be either direct or indirect. So lll. 1. 21, dixtine,
quaeso, Ill. 1. 81, vide num moratur. But in many cases
the question must be indirect, as in IV. r. 19, scio quo pro·
peras, “l know whither you are hastening.'’ ln l. 3. 42,
rem vides, puae sim ei quoefui ante, the subjunc. and indic'.
are used together. Comp. also note on Ι. 1. 9. (Ε.Ι Becker.

spons, and so was living happily and pleasantly.'' Acidalius
supplies houd, and Ritschl supposes the omission oi a line.
