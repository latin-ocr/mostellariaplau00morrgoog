ner 11. scurra 1. 105

I. 4 6, ceterum cura. C. Licet. In each case render, “lt
shall be done‚’' or “l will.'’

57. Numquid aliud, sc. vis. “You don’t want anything else, do .
you?” The ordinary formula ior taking leave. So num-
·quid vis? Hor. Sat. l. 9. 6.

57. Clavem Laconicam. Large three-toothed keys, which locked
the door lrom the outside. No good explanation oi the
name or of the manner of working has been proposed. lt
seems probable, from this passage, that a person on the out·
side could tell whether the door had been locked from within
or from without.

58. Hinc foris, “irom this side, without,” so that the house might
seem to have been deserted.

59. Alter this line the others go into the house, leaving Tranio
alone.

60—70. These lines are somewhat confused in the MSS. and have
been the subject oi much conjecture and comment. Partic-¹
ularly, the word proprior is read proptor in several MSS,
probetur in Vulg, and probrior by Rit. The best notes on
line 60 are by Taubmann, Lorenz, Rost (Opusc. 1. 135) and
Ritschl, but they are widely at variance with e'ach other.

The general sense oi this passage is this: lt makes no differ-
ence who a man is, ii he lack courage. Any man can act

, foolishly on short notice, but it requires a wise manto bring
good results out of things which have been foolishly begun.

60. Pluma seems to be a nom. So twice in Ter. with interest.

60. cluens :cliens Render‚ “whether patron or client be the
role assigned to a man,” etc.

61. Quoi, the orig. form from stem quo-of qui. Qu· was often
used forc (comp. cocus, l. 3. 120), and about 200 Β. c. there
was a general wealrening oi 0 to n. The form coi does not
appear, and the two changes seem to have taken place to·
gether in this word. So quoius, cujus.

62. Homini, dat. afterfacr'le est. Optuma and pessumo repeat the
idea oi patronus and cluens.

⁸ ⁶3· Quamvis desubito. “on however short a notice ” (Ram).
