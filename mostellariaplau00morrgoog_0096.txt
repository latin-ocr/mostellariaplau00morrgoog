6. Quid. malum, “why the mischief‚” “why the deuce,’' Germ.
“zum Henker.’' Very common in Pl. and Ter. Taken
with clamatio est, the words may be rendered “ why the mis·
chief are you shouting ? ” This use of the verbal substan-
tive is equivalent in some cases to the inf, as Poen. V. 2.

· 136, acerba ornatio est: acerbum est amare. or to the
gerundive, as Pseud. Ι. 2. 37, cautio ert milti=caven-
dum est milri, or most frequently as here· to the finite
verb. So Trin. ΙΙΙ. 2. 83, quid tibi interpellatio est?
“why do you interfere?’' Te'r. Eun. lv. 4. 4, quid fruc
ribi reditio est? “why do you corne back here ?'' (bor.
Wag. Hild.)

6. Aedis = aedes. The endings -es and -is for acc. plu. 3d decl.

M.43,2; H.65; A.&G. 583 G.60, 1.

7. An frequently introduces the second part of a disjunctive ques·
tion, of which the first part may generally be supplied by the
phrase, “Am l mistaken, or,” etc. Such questions express
the real or pretended surprise, incredulity or indignation of
the speaker, when there is a contradiction between what
would naturally be expected and what is evidently the case
or is asserted to be the case. ln this passage the full form
would be, (⁶⁴ do you not know you are in the city, as you evi-
dently are), ordo you suppose that you are in the country,
(as your shouting would lead any one to think) ? '' Render‚

’ “ You think you are in the country, don't you ἓ '' So in ΙΙ.
2. 24, Eleo, an lu tetigisti has aedis? “ You have n't touched
this house, have you ? '² “(Have you let this haunted house
alone, as any one mffght expect you would) or have you
touched it (as your words evidently indicate) ?'’ So V. 2. 20.
Less commonly in dialogue an expresses doubt inclining to
one side or the other, as in Ι. 4. 20, an scis? “ Ι don’t think
you know, do you?'’ These questions are especially fre·
