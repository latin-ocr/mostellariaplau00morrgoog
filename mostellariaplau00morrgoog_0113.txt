84 nores. Ι

This use of rii with general reference to the subject in hand
would hardly be allowed by Augustan prose usage, but is
found frequently in Pl. as in Aul. prol. ro, T rin. ΙΙ. 44

After this line Philolaches retires to the side or back of the stage, perhaps to one
of the streets leading from the front to the rear, where he can be seen by the spec-
tators, but not by the other actors.

. ACT Ι. SCENE 111.

Philematium and Scapha, her maid, come out froin the house of Philolaches, the
latter carrying a small casket or dressingcase.

On the violations of stage illusion in this scene, consult Introduction.

1. Ecastor. This oath is stated by Α. Gellius to have been used
only by women, as Hercle only by men, and the usage of ·ΡΙ.
supports this, except in a few instances‚ where the apparent
contradiction Is probably due to mistalres in the distribution
of the dialogue. See And. Lex. where this statement is
denied‚ and Ram. Excurs. XVII, where it is satisfactorily
supported.

1. Frigida The three baths were sudatoria, tepidario, and frigida.

2. Rear. Lorenz calls the use of the present tense after lavi a
violation of the sequence of tenses, but may it notbe said
that esse defaecatam is logically the leading verb, while rear
is logically parenthetic and present in tense? The sense
would then be, “when Ι have been better cleansed, Ι think.’'

3. Homo, adq, “this year.” This line seems to have been a
proverb, which Scapha quotes without rnuch connection,
from mere good spirits and gayety. Philem. sees no connec-
tion, and Sc. herself confesses that there is none. A similar
pass occurs in Merc. V. 2. 101, sqq. (Lor) Thornton’s
Pl. refers to Ι Henry IV, Act Ι, Sc. ΙΙ.

- 4. AttInet. etc. “What has that harvest to do with my bath ?'’

5. Venus venusta, “lovely goddess of love.’' Comp. grates gram, .

amoeno amoenitate amoenus, and similar examples of the
figuracfymologico. (Lor.)
