adopts in the text. Hunc vt'cinum is Simo, and Tran. means
that lte will tum the lie over upon Simo by saying that it is
his house which Philol. has bought.

131. Calidum is used in its original sense here, while in 130 it is
in the derived sense ol “ready‚’' “quick.'’ This line, 131,
stands in the MSS. after 76, where it makes no sense at all;
it was transferred to this place by Acid. followed by most
later editors. There seems to be no equivalent play upon
words in English. ,

der “against a rock,” the figure being that oi a ship. (Ram.)

144. Ocius lor positive ocior, which is rare. So Ter. Hor. Caes.
