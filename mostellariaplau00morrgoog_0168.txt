Aer 1v. senua 11. 139

19. Ne quid. . . stt. sc. metuo. The ellipsis is frequent; it occurs
in Stich. IV. 2. 20, Pseud. l. 5. 22, and elsewhere. (Lor)
Caprium, dat. of end or purpose, or predicative dat. (Roby);
comp. cordi, l. 4. 10. captio may well enough be taken in

its original sense, “a snare‚” “a iraud,’' not as in And. Lex.
20. Modo goes with ioculo, “in jest even.'’ Notice the indigna·

tion expresse'd by -ne appended to ego.

21. Aps te . . . cavere. So Men. l. 2. 42, aps te caveo, Men. ll. r.

41, aps te metuo, and frequently alter verbs of caution or '

. lear. Plautus in several places makes his old men brag ol

, their watchlulness just when they are most deceived, e. g.‚ ’
Capt. ll. 2. 5 sqq.

22. Quia The leading verb is omitted. “Do you say that, be-
'cause‚” etc.

24. Sat sapio. The meaning is, l am showing wisdom enough it
l succeed in avoiding your tricks. Tranio's answer has a
double sense, because the spectators know that he is really
deceiving Theur. while he speaks.

25. Rus. This evidently implies a statement lrom Tran. that
Philol. had gone out to the country-seat, lrom which Grumio
came in the first scene. No such statement appears in the
play, however; it may have been lost, or the discrepancy
may have been overlooked by Pl.

27. Posttoum. The back-door os the Roman house, opening from
the garden into a side-street, through which Tran. could

· enter unseen by Theur.

27. congerrones. A word ot doubtful etymol. and meaning.
Ram. seems to refer it to gerrae, “nonsense‚” making it ¹
mean “companions in trifling.'' Rost. (Opusc. 1. 280-284)
makes it the same as congerones, “ thieves.” The delinition
in And. Lex. will suit all passages. The word is not found
out of Ph, except in the grammarians. ἵ
