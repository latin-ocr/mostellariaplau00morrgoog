98 ’ noras,

The following are among the general characteristics there

’ given: “This dat. is (r) asemi-abstract substantive, (2) in
the singular number, (3) used predicatively‚ (4) and most

Ἰ “ frequently with cst. lt is not qualified (5) by any adjective
except the simplest adjectives oi quantity, nor (6) by a geni·
tive or prepositional phrase.'' Cordi is found eight times in
Pl. and may generally be rendered “dean” But-here ren-
der, “ is you want to do it.’'

11. Duce for duc is used several times by Pl. as sace, dice, for sac, Ι

dr'c. . -

13. Modo, “only,'’ from modus in the sense oi a limit. (Ram.·

Excurs. V.)

13. Accumbas, the regular word ior reclining at the table, as in I.
3.150. “Take care that you do not recline in the street
instead of at the table.''

15. The latter part oi this line is so confused in the MSS. that
little can be made oi it. As it stands it indicates that Call.
is still supporting himself by clinging to Delplr, to whose
body hoc refers. The construction is sed sine et lzoc cadere.

17. This line is given by some editors to Call. A similar line
occurs in Pseud. V. 1. 2, an id voltis ut me llic iacentem
aliquis tollat?

18. Madet homo. This is said in an undertone, but is heard by
Call, who expresses his indignation in the next question by
appending neto the pron. Comp. l. 3. 143.

19. Call. had fallen, perhaps atter line 15, and in the next line, 20,
Delph. lifts him up again.

22. Imo or t'mnw. Authorities differ as to spelling, etymol. and
meaning. Perhaps the best opinion is that which spells it
(in authors later than Pl. and Ter.) immo, from imus (ior
'im'mus‚ superlative of in), meaning “at the bottom,'' “in the
least.” ln Pl. and Ter. always neg. The uses os imo de·
note:-

(a.) Simple contradiction, as in this pass. and in ll Ι. 1. 22, 52, 60.

(b.) Correction os an inadequate statement, as in IV. 2. 4, IV.
4. 38, or a statement wrong in some particular, as in IV.
