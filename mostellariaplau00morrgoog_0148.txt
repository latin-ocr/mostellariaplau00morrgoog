two other passages before the post-class. writers, viz., Bacch.
IV. 2. 3, and Lucr. lll. 489. (Ram.)

62.1n manu. “in your power.’' So Mero. Ill. 4. 43, tillio
ruonucsl.

63. lle γρῦ quidem, “not even agrunt can you get from him‚’' i. e,
irom Philol. Οὐδὲ γρῦ is used in this way hy Aristoph. and

Dem. (Lor.)

64-66. These lines are much mutilated in the MSS„ and the con-
jectures, by which Cam. filled the blanks‚ do not make a very
perfect text.

65. flio, Philol. Before linquat, sc. ul. “That he shall leave the
city, being made an exile for your sake? he, who will scarcely
be able to pay the principal ?” ¹

66 Quin “Why, l tell you, l do not ask lor the principal.’'

74. Veterator. A conj. of Cam. The word is not found in Pl,
hut is used by Ter. and Cic. The orig. meaning is an old
slave, opposed to uow'tius, and hence one who is old in ras·
¹cality. “Old sharper.”

75. Quemquam agrees as an adj. pron. with beluam. The masc.
quisquam is several times used by Pl. with lem. nouns. So
Rud. 1. 3. 75, onum quemquam, Mil. Glor. lV. 2. 68, quem-
quam porculum. So also quisque, quisquis and querare
used in masc. forms with fem. nouns. (Lor.)

76. Edepol is made up ol prefix e· (ecastor, eqru'riue), the voc. of
deus, dee, dc, and the shortened form of Pollux. (Lor.) The
Roman grammarians spelled it aedepol, and derived it irom
aedis Pollucis.

77. Theur. has been standing at a distance, but overhearing some
part of the dispute‚ particularly the word faenus, which the
Danista had shouted out loudly in 70, 72, he cornes up to
investigate. The next four lines are spoken rapidly in an
undertone, as Theur. crosses the stage.

80. Inoouolliare. Key, followed by Wag. and Roby. suggests a
derivation from cellum, “a small hair.” The verb would
then mean ·“to entangle‚'' “to involve in difficulties.'' Ram'
gives it, “to raise a disturbance against.'’ Either meaning
