ACT V. SCENE Ῑ.

ACT V. SCENE Ι.

The following scene is not a canticum, but is spoken by Tranio himself, who
comes on the stage as il from the country.

1·. nauci. The construction is like that of nihili, l. 2. 70. Ex-
cept in one pass. it always has a neg. with it. Brix (Trin.
396) suggests that nauci may be connected with nugae,
through the form nangae, which is given by some MSS.

3. Nam introduces an explanation, as in Amph. Prol. 104, Truc.
lV. 4. 3, where some general phrase may be supplied. “I
am led to make this remark, sor,’' etc. There is no need ol
supposing that a line has dropped out, as Rit. and Lor. often
do. (See Ram. Excurs. Vl.)

4. Angiportum, a narrow lane between two blocks oi houses, as in
Pseud. IV. 2. 6, or a private passage-way between two

· houses, as chere. Such a passage, leading from a side-street
to the garden, may be seen in the plan of the “ House of the
Tragic Poet,” in Becker's Gallus or Smith's Dict. Antiq.

5. Ostium quod=quad ostium. (M. 319.) Supply eins as
anteced, depending on sores. Ostium is the doorway ;fares
are the doors by which the doorway is closed. Connect
horti with angiportu.

9. Quom . . . etque, “when . . . at once.'’ Comp. Epid. 11. 2. 33,
qaam venia, atque ega vt'daa, “when 1 come, at once 1 see,'’
etc. So also nt. . . atqua. Comp. analogous uses of atquc
in11.2. 57, and Ill. z. 138.

ro. vorti...in meo foro, “that the matter is referred to my
court;'' strictly “is carried on in my court,” spoken as il he
were the presiding judge. The more common explanation,
which makes Tran. put himself in the position oi the ac·
cused, is incorrect. (See Rost, p. ¹37·)

On the sentiment ol the following lines comp. III. 1. 15. The
same figure oi disturbed wine has been used in Il. 1. 68.

. ¹3- clam senens Clam is used only once or twice as a prepos.
