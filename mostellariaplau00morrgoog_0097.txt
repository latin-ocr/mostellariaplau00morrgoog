7. Apscede :abscedo This early spelling is well established
from inscriptions Comp. nore on aps, ΙΙΙ. 1. 118.

8. Abi dissecto, “ go and be hanged.” The meaning of dz'ercctc is
evident from many passages in Pl, but the etymol. has oc·
casioned much discussion. The most plausible derivationis
that suggested by Rost and adopted by Ram. and Lon, from
dist-ergo, referring to the position of the criminal‚ raised up
(erigo) and spread out (dis) upon the cross.

9. Bm With the word Tran. gives him a blow. “ There! was it
this that you wanted ἓ ”

9. Hocine. Hoc with the e which followed those cases of lrt’c
which end in c, shortened to i when the interrog. suffix ne is
appended. “less correctly‚’' hoccine. M. 81, obs.; G. 102,

9. Petita common exclamation of pain or fear. Peri. for pres.

Many of the differences between the linguage of Pl. and Ter..
and that of classical prose, may be traced to one cause, viz. '
the desire for the most vivid and forcihle expression. This
appears in the use
a)Of Ofthe fut perf. for the fut, of the perf. for the pres. and
’ the plup for perf definite. (Seel..3 54.) ·
b)0fpres.f or f.ut (Seelll. 2. 85)
c.O)Ofsut.1ndicforrmpv (Seell. 294.)

d.)O frequentative for simple verbs (Seel. 1. 51.)

(

(e. Of synonymous words particularly adverbs (Seel. 2. 17.)

To the same cause may probably be referred the use

(f.O)ffu1', fueram, fuero for sum, eram, cro, with the perf.

pass. participle. (See ΙΙΙ. 2. 5.)

(g.O) findic. for subjuncto indirect questions (See 1. 2. 64.)

These peculiarities of style are not confined to comedy‚ but only
show themselves most prominently there. Usages corre·
sponding to several may be observed in English conversa-
tional style.
