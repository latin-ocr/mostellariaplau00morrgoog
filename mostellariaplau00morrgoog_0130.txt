in letters. So ulmz'triba, Pers. ΙΙ. 4. 7. These words were
doubtless coined by Pl. lor comic effect, and lor that purpose
a hybrid word was used rather than the pure Latin ferriteri,
which rs used in rrin.1v.3. 14. (See nost. opusc. 1.'
25¹-)

10. Trium numerum. The exact force ol these words is a matter

· ol dispute. Numus in ΡΙ. means the Attic didrachma when-
ever it refers to a definite sum, and ii that is the case here,
tres numi means the monthly pay oi aRoman soldier. So
Ram. takes it. lor. thinks it is a confusion resulting {rom
carelessness in translating from the Greek ln any case, the
sum is a small one, ridiculously small in proportion to the

ἢ danger. The same sum, paid lor a trick which involved no.
risk or labor, gives the name to the Trinummus.

11. Aliqui, subj. of solent, Corpus, acc oi part referred to.

12 sq. Lor. remarks on this passage that Pl. does not shrink
from jesting about the most severe punishments. Many
phrases, as abi in molam crucem, dierecte, etc, were used as
expletives without much thought os their meaning, and it
must be remembered also that these punishments were olten
threatened, but seldom employed.

13. Lege, “on this condition.'’ For explan. oi the remainder ol
this line, ¹see l. 1. 52.

14. Argentum . . . praesentarium, “ready money,” “cash.” So
IV. 2. 10. The classical word is praesens. (Wag.)

15· Curriculo, originally au abl, but used by Pl. as an adv,
“quickly.’' Quite common. See And. Lex. s. v.

16. 0ps0n1um ὀψον meant anything eaten as a relish with
bread, and especially, as here, fish, which was a lavorite
article oi sood with the Athenians.

18. Ted = te. The d at the end ol this word was frequently used
in the early Latin aster the abl. ot nouns and pron, and seems
to have been incorrectly transferred to the acc. me, te, and
perhaps se. The extent ol its use m Pl. is a, matter of doubt, ‚
but med, ted are found a number ol times in good MSS.
