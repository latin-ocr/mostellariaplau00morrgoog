ACT 1. SCENE 1v.

ACT l. SCENE IV.

Callidamates and Delphium come along the street, followed by several slaves.
Philol. and Phliem. remain at the table awaiting their coming.

Throughout this scene the metres, the division ol lines, and even the distribution
oi the dialogue among the characters, are extremely confused in the MSS. Those
editors who make changes lor metricat reasons have remodelled the scene in various
ways, according to their theories.

r. Advorsum venire. Comp. note on Advorsitar in list oi Per·
sonae. '

2. Temperi. Sometimes spelled temporihut the word is used
nineteen times by Ρ]., and in all cases but one the hest
MSS. read temperi. (Wag.) This is the locative caseos
tempus.

2. 'ribi refers to one oi the slaves, perhaps to Phaniscus, who
periorms the office oi Α deors-iter in IV. 3.

3. Illi is the locative from ille lor the more common illic, which is
locative from nom. illic (ille -l- ce), like adv. hic from pron.
hic. So V. 3. 22, isti ior istm Used pleonastically with
inde, as in Ter. And. IV. 1. 14, illic, ubi . . . est, ihi verentur.

5. Philolachetem. Greek proper names are treated with some
freedom by the comic writers especially those ending in -ης,
from which various forms are made according to the metre.

¹ Beside the two acc. iorms here and above, the dat. is either
Philolachi or Philolacheti, abl. Philolache or Philolachete.
So Ter. has from nom. Chremes (aa) Chremem or Chreme-

tem, Chremi (gen.) or Chremetis. (Lor.) See M. 45, 2, e.

6. vbi . . . accipiet. used lreely for qui. . . accipiet. “To the
house oi Philol., where he will,” etc.

7. Ma-ma·madere, ‘tt-t-tipsy.’' Medea and madidas are used
euphemistically to denote intoxication. There is special
point in making Call. stumble over this particular word.

390. Or dat. ol purpose, service, or end, A.&G. 233. For
