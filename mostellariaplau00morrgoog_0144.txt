ACT 111. SCENE Ι. 115

9. Huic refers to the danista, but in next line iic refers to Theur.

Such use of the sarne pronoun to refer to different persons

· would hardly be found in careful prose, but is natural in
conversation, where the speaker turns irorn one person to
another, so that each in turn becomes hic to him. So iste,
134, 135 of this scene.

11. Indaudiverit= inaud-. The old form indu (indo) foria is
used by Pl. only in* this verb. Comp. Aul. ll. 2. 88, Capt.
Prol. 30, etc. lt is found in Lucr. and in the XII. Tahles‚
and remained in classical Latin in the words indigeo (indu-
αμα), indigena, indrjriz'scor. (Lor.) Also indoles, industrio.

13. Animus hominis conscius. Hominis is poss. gen. with

’ animus. With conscius supply sibi mali. The absolute use
of comcius with mali understood is found in later Latin, and
survives in the Engl. “conscience,” i. e., “consciousness of
evil.”

15. Turbata, “to create conlusion‚'' asin V. 1. 12, where the
same idea is more fully expressed, viz.‚ that one who is
already in difficulty should seelr to increase the confusion in
order to escape unnoticed.

16. Vnde is‘? “Whence do you corne ?’' though ire in this sense
is rare. Comp. Cas. ll. 3. 29. The words are addressed to
Theur.

16. Vnde = a quo (maso). So also IV. 4. 5, and hinc = abhoc,
lll. 1. 113. Similar usages are found in good prose. (Lor.)
M. 317,ohs.2. ¹

17. Illo, the story about the rnurder. Notice that numquid, im·
plying a negative, is met by hercle vero and hy the emphatic
position of dixi.

19. Teohinae = technae, for τέχναι. This is the reading of the
best MSS.‚ though Ram. has technae. Some Greek combi-
nations were avoided in the Latin, particularly in the early
writers. by the insertion of a short vowel. Thus χμ, xp, were
separatedby d. as δραχμή, drachma· χν, κν, μυ, by l, as μνᾶ,
mt'na,· and κλ byei. (Lot. Rit.)

20. Enim frequently implies an ellipsis ol the leading clause.
