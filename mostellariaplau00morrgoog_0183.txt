Ol these Ritschl's edition is the most valuable. Hildyard has
Latin notes and an excellent Glossary, with indexs but the text is
not good. Brix and Lorenz have lull and very good German
notes. Wagner's plays are the best in English lor the college
student. Sonnenschein’s Captivi isan English translation of the
edition oi Brix‚ with some additional notes. For the student who
has read two or three playS, Ramsay's Mostellaria, though it is
incomplete and leaves many points untouched‚ is by lar the best
English edition.

Explanations of the metre and prosody ol Plautus are given by
Wagner (Aul), Ramsay, Brix (Trio), and Sonnenschein. More
extended statements will be found in thesProlegomena to Ritschl’s
Trinummus and in Hermann's Elementa (or Epitome) Doctrinae
Metricae. All these are largely indebted to the De Mettis Teren-
tianis Schediasma, prefixed to Bentley's Terence.
