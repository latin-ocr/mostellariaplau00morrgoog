-PREFAOE

-—000—

Tris text ol this edition follows that given in Ramsay’s
Mostellaria, which is based upon the Codex Vetus of Came·

rarius, with corrections lrom the Codex Decurtatus and the
Codex UrsinianuS, and from the Milan Palimpsest, wherever

that ean be read. In a few cases other readings than Ram-
say’s have been adopted, and in some passages the punctua-
tion has been altered.

The substance of the general Introduction is from
’ Mommsen, and the remarks on the Mostellaria from Lorenz

and some other sources. They contain nothing new, but

are inserted lor the convenience ol students.

The notes are mainly from the editions of which a list
is given at the end ol the book. Ι have intended to give
credit lor all notes which are taken without material change
from another edition, but some have been so altered that
it seemed hardly correct to attribute them to the editor by
whom they were suggested. These, with the lew which are
original, are therefore leit unsigned.
