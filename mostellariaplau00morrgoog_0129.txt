ACT 11. SCENE Ι.

For the division into Acts, see Intro. At this point the banquet went on without
interruption, and it is the opinion oi Lorenz that the spectatore were entertained
with music given by the tibicen. Comp. Pseud 1. 5, last line, tibicen vos interea
bic delectaverit. Tranio, who had gone to the fish marhet in the Piraeus (1. 1.
63-4, 72), comes back,and pauses at one side oi the stage to speak the lines 1-1 5.

r. Opibus atque industriis, “with all his might and main.”
Industria in the plu. is found nowhere except here, and
Ram. suggests that it may be a bit of bad grammar used to
raise a laugh. That is possible, but abstracte are very com·
monly used in the plu. by Pl, where class. usage requires the
sing, as superbiae atque irae, gratiae, etc. (Lor. and Wag.)

2. Perisse (periisse) :perditos esse.

3. Stabulum. . . confidentiae, “a standing-place ior confidence.”
ln the same figurative sense in Aul. 11. 2. 56, stabile stabulum.

¹comp. Capt. 111. 3. 14, and Ter. Adelph. IV. 7. 43, ipsa si
cupiat Salus, servare. . . nrm potest. For the condition si
cupiat... potest, see A& G.307,d; H. 512, 1.

ς. Ad portum, “at the harbor.” So adfurum, “at the iorum‚”
111. 2, 156, and 111. 4 7. The construction is not uncom-
mon in Pl. Comp. the regular class. phrase ad omnia pul-
vinaria, “at all the shrines,'' Cic. Cat. 111. 10, ²3·

7. Facere...luori, “to gain.¹' Comp. compendi facere, Ι, 1. 57.
Lucri is notan appos. oi argente, as Ram. says, an explana-
tion which would s'erve ior this passage only. Aliquantum
is object olfacere, and argenti gen. partit.

8. Vloem is used with a gen. or poss. pron, particularly aiter
words which denote a'n emotion ot the mind. lt is called
'adverbial acc. by Madvig, 237, c, obs. 33 G. 331, 33 Α. δι G.
240, b; H. 380, 2, and acc. oi the part concerned by Roby,
