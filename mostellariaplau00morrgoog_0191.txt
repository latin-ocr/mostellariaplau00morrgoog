Jersey. temo, 289pages. slot.

The text of this edition follows in the mein that of Breitenbacht Berlin, 1878), end
every effert has been uredo to pivs the results of recent scholnrship. The text is
separated into convenient divisione hy English summaries, which take the pluce of
the customary argument prefixed to the chapters‚ and put a logical analysis of the
text where it cannot escape the attention of the student. The notes ere designedly
computet, yet ere believed to contem ull that is practrcslly useful to the student.
The references to Goodwin's Grammar, his lloods end Tenses, to Hadley’s Grem-
msr, and occasionslly to others have been mede very tull, especially on the earlier
portions of the text. The editor hes uiso endeavored to supply brief sketches of
every thing of biographical historicsl‚ or philosophical interest. ¹

“lt supplies a want long teir, andl hove no doubt will be lurgeiy used, cs it de-
serves. The introduction of the summaries into the text adds greatly to its vulne,
while the notes are succina, with good references and apt illustrations.'¹ - Prcff.
A. C. Maeniam, Columbia correpsisse l'orlr.

“The notes ere excellent, the pemgrephing of the text is a great end valuable
help to studente, und the hook itself is a model of nentness. It is one of the few
unexceptionnbly well edited school-books in my librury. 1 shall use it in nry
classes exclusively when we read the ‘Memorabilis’ ¹¹ —Profi C. M. Mose, Wes-
Ieyan Universt'ty, Illincr's.

“l have used it with my Freshman Class during the pust year with much sotis-
fsction. Iparticularly approve of the subdivisions of the cimptersand the head-
notes to each of them, end have found the explanatory nores and grammatical
references to be of great benefit to the pupils.'’ -Prcs. H. ert'telorne, Unico Col·
feye, Selenectady, N. Y.

“ Winuns's ‘Memorabilia‘ has ntet the needs of our studente excellently well.
The page is neat, the notes happy; translations ere sparse and discreet‚ and the
general references accurate and suggestiua. We shull certainly continue its use.''
