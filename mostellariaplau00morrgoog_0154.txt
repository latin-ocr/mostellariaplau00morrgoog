ACT 111. SCENE 11. 125

5. Visum fult: visum est. The use oi peri. part. with fui for

sum is very rare in classieal writers, but very frequent in ,

Pl. So in this play 111. 2.132,empti fuerant, lV. 4 2,
vectus fui, and olten. See M. 344, where such forms are
said to be incorreet. They may have arisen in popular
speech from the feeling that the forms in sum, eram, ero, did
not sufficiently indicate the past time ol the verb. Comp.

the incorreet Engl. phrase “he wanted to have gone,’' lor ,

“ he wanted to go.'’ See note on l. r. 9.

8. De prandio, “ after dinner.'' A very rare sense of de except in
diem de die, “day after day.’'

9. Clanculum, diminutive os clam, found only in Pl. and Ter.
“ Very secretly.’'

13. “When l think it over further in my mind, (l conclude that)
sleep,’' etc. A similar omission of the real leading verb
occurs alter cogitare in this scene, 101, 102. (Lor.)

15. Neminem = non eum‚· the negatiye modifies the verb and
eum is the anteced. ol quis, 14. Rit. reads eum katerinam
on conj.

15. Sollicitat, “tempts,‘' t‘attracts'’ And. Lex. refers to this
pass. under the meaning “to disturb‚ vex,'’ which would
suit Ritschl's text, but no other.

16. omnibus ...odio est, “is hatetul.” So Men. 1. 2. 2, viro η

esseodth . . . tibiodio. Comp. note on cordi, l.4 ιο. ,

17. Certa res est “l am determined.” So Amph. ll. 2. 73, and

in a few other places for the much more common certum est,
ι e.g,1.3.8o.'

19. Vt moribus, “ how yours may be in character,” torquibus
moribus or ut rnoratae. (Lor.)

zo. vostrae, addressed to the spectators.

20. Haeo, by its emphatic position, is put in contrast with vostrae.
“This one-l know well enough how badly,’' etc. The
next line depends upon scio.

· 23. Ullum=quemquam. Ullus is used as a substantive by the

best writers only in gen, dat. and abl. The use ol acc. as

here is very rare. See M. 90, 3, obs.
