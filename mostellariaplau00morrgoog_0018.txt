' The change in the public games which led to the introduc-
tion of the regular comedy was looked upon with suspicion
by the Roman magistrates. They had, perhaps, no Poticesl- Ἴ
definite theory of the duties of a good citizen, but perusion'
the whole tone of life in the first centuries of the Republic
was stern and severe, and the leading men felt an instinctive
dislike to the idle amusement ol the drama. So while they
did not forbid the innovation which naturalized comedy in·
Rome, they put several embarrassing impediments in its way.
For-one thing, they refused to allow the erectiori of a perma-
nent theatre, and though astone building is supposed to have
been erected in 179 Β. c, it was taken down when the garnes'
were over. The plays themselves, also, were subjected to a
rigid censotship, and no allusion of any sort to public men or
to government measures was allowed. The poet Naevius
suffered imprisonment under the strict libel laws for some
stage invectires‚ and so watchful were the police that in the
twenty plays of Plautus written during the stirring times of
the Second Punic War, there is only one distinct allusion to
the conflict which was then going on within and without the
city. It is from this cause that a large number of the corne·
dies contain no reference definite enough to fix the date at
which they were produced. Still further, in order to empha-
size the fact that comedy was an imported luxury and was
only admitted on sufferance, no free Roman appeared as an
actor in the time of PlautuS, and the poet was forbidden to
present his characters as Romans. Itwas necessary that the
play should bear on its face the evidence of its foreign origin.
Greek names were therefore retained for the personS, the ·
scene was laid in Greece, the actors wore Greek costumas,
