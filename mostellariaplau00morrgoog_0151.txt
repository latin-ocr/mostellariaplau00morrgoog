The word is used by Pl. without reference to age to indicate
familiarity‚ or by a superior to an inlerior in station, as here.
So Engl. “my lad.” (Ram.) See example in next note.

118. Mecum rem habe, “trent with me in the matter,” 1. e, “look
to me sor your money.” Comp. Men. 111. 2, 29, adulescens,
