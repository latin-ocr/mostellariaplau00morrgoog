ior the perf, but here the reason given does not seem appii·
cable. The plupi. seems to be used in order to give an
opportunity ior Tranio’s comment, “Did you hear him say
they had been, as is they were no longer his?’' ln 134 Simo
uses the peri. dedi of the same transaction, but in 132 Theur.
says emeras because he believes that the house no longer
belongs to Simo.

¹33· Vix . . lacrumas. Lor. suggests that Simo may bave spoken
the words Pol . . . ulain with a mourniul shake oi the head, as ·
a man might speak of his past extravagance.

13 ς. Multum, sor abl. oi degree oi difference. See M. 270, obs. 1 ;
H. 418, 13 G. 400, 2.

137. Intempestivos. Winter was the proper season ior felling
timber, and wood cut at another time was liable to decay.

138. Atque. “and yet.” So Trin. ll. 2. 55, qui . . . nusquam. . .
rem confregit, atque eget, “never used up his property, and
yet isin want.” So Men. lV. 2. 2. (Hild. Wag.)

139. Pultiphagus opifex. . . barbarus. The iood oi the Roman
lower classes was a porridge made offar, and called puls or

’ pulmentum. Pulliplzugus or pultifagur therefore refers to

the Romans. It is irom puls and the stem puy. orasRost ’

says, lrom ποἊτος and day. Pl. often places himseli in the
position ola Greek and calls the Romans barbari, both to
raise a laugh and to satisfy the police censors by keeping
some Greek tone in the play. See lntro. (Ram. Lamb.
See also Rost. Opusc. l. pp. ²47-252·)

140. Dormlunt. A comic use oi the word, which Tran. is obliged
to explain to Theur. Coniueut (connivent), which is offered
as an explanation, is used in the same comic way, with even
greater departure from the original sense, “to wink.” The
idea of both here is “to rest securely.”

142. Satin’ habes‘? “ Now do you get the idea?'’

14²· Quicquid sor quicque, as oiten in the comic writers. Μ.

143. cornix, volturios. The cornix is the common type oi a cun-
ning and crafty fellow, and the vollurius oi a rapacious man.
