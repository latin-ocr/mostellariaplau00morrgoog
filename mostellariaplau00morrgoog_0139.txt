45. Antiquom et vetua The distinction between these words
must be observed here. See And. Lex. antiquus.

46. Adeo, “ and so‚” “therefore'’ “lt was done long ago, and so

53-55. cenaverat... redit . . . abimus . . . condormrvtmus. Tran.
begins his story with the plupi, the natural tense, but the
excitement hurries him into the pres. and perf. definite.
Such change ol tense is characteristic of dialogue. (Lor.)

cenaverat, “had dined out;’‘ foras cenare, “to go out to
dinner.'’ Conrp.l.1. 1.

62. Mirum, quin. This common Plautine phrase expresses great
contempt lor some previous statement. The literal sense is
“ it is wonderful how not‚'' but it may be rendered often
ironically‚ “it is very likely that.‘’ Amph. ll. 2. 118, mirum
quin ie advorsus dicat, “it is wonderful that he (your slave)
