NOTES.

ACT IV. SCENE ΙΙΙ.

Phaniscus and the other Advorsitor come out lrom the vestibulum, and continue
their attempts to enter the house oi Philolaches. They are now ior the first time
noticed by Theuropides, who had before been occupied with Tranio.

2. Tibicinum. Fine-girls, who sometimes danced while playing,
were introduced at seasts to amuse the guests. Comp. Xen.
Symp. Il.1. Canto is the reg. verb for playing upon the
tibia. Comp. tibicen (tibia -l- cano).

3. Iulo, the adv. But two good MSS. give illisce, which may be
the correct reading. Comp. ll. 2. 77.

4. Introspectant. Becker suggests that this may referto looking
in at the windows, which in that case must have been low.
But it is unusual in a Roman house to find any windows
toward the street. lt may perhaps refer to looking through
the hey-bole, which was a large aperture in the door, lt
must be noticed that these slaves do not seem to observe
that the house has been locked lrom without by the clavis
Laconica.

5. Fabula means their knocking at a house which Theur. supposes
to have been closed ior six months. The same phrase
occurs in Ter. Andr. IV. 4. 8, where Colman translates,
“What larce is this ?”

7. After this line the Milan Palimpsest gives six lines which are
not iound in any other MS, but the writing is so taint that
only a lew words can be made out.

9. Fuere, voc. irom the orig. torm puerus.

9. Nimium delicatus es, “ you are too much oi a joker.'’ This
sense os delicatus is rare, and is not given in And. Lex. 80,
possibly, in Rud. ll. 5. 8. Comp. the common phrase deli-
cias facere, “to johe.” (Taub. Ram) Lor. compares
τρυφάω, which has two meanings correspondiug to those oi
delzcatus.

11. Nam, “l give you this explanation, ior,” etc. Probrum, be-
cause of his respectlul manner, which appears throughout
the dialogue.
