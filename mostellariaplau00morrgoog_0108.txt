jectural and doubtful. As it stands,'sunply expetuntTrom

19. “ Eaeh one seeks for himself a similar model, even at¹
his own expense.’'

21. Nequam is probably an adverbial acc. with some tem. noun
like virtutem understood. lt is used by Pl. as an indeclin-
able adj. among words ot bad meaning, as Asin. ll. 2. 39,
malus nequamque, and ln contrast to frugi, Pseud. I. 5. 53.
Render, “worthlesS,” “ good-lor-nothlng.''

22. Familia,'the household ot slaves, who would be careless in
their treatment of a house. ·

25. tegulas imbrioeeque, “ tiles and guttere '³ (Ram.) or “roofing-
tiles and joint-tiles'’ (Smith’s Dict. Antiq.)‚ together equiv.

26. Reddere aliae, “to make them new,” ‘⁴ to replace with others.'³

26. Nevolt = eanvult. H. 293, 33 M. 157, obs. The other forms

nemo, neuter, nequidem, etc. .

27. Perpluont. The compounds ot pluo are used five times by
Pl, four of them in this play. Ptuo is generally intrans and
so perplue, t‘ to let the rain through,” as in this pass and in
Trln. Il. 2. 41, ne perpluant, “lest they let the rain
through.” But pluo also takes an object of the thing rained
down as sanguinem pluere, “to rain blood,⁷’ and from this
comes the trans. use ol perpluo in Ι. 3. 8, tempestas . ..
quam milti Amor et C tepido e'n pectus perpluit meum, “ which
Love rained through (poured through my covering of mod-

esty) into my breast.’' Also pluo ls usually impers, but '

perplue in this sense is often personat. Comp. note on lV.
